# USBIP bridge — VGS wheel simulator for PitHouse

Expose the Linux wheel simulator to a Windows host as a real USB device so
PitHouse enumerates a VGS wheel (VID `0x346E` PID `0x0006`) and runs its full
probe sequence. Required because PitHouse filters devices via WMI on
`VID_346E%` — a plain virtual COM port does not qualify.

Pipeline:

```
wheel_sim.py ↔ /dev/ttyGS0 ↔ libcomposite (CDC ACM) ↔ dummy_hcd ↔ usbipd
                                                                    ↕  (TCP/3240)
                                                                 usbip-win2 → PitHouse
```

## Prerequisites

**Linux (gadget side):**

- `dummy_hcd` kernel module (stock on most Arch/Debian kernels)
- `libcomposite` kernel module (stock)
- `usbip` userspace tools
  - Arch: `sudo pacman -S usbip`
  - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install linux-tools-generic`
- Root access (configfs + usbipd)

Verify before starting:

```bash
find /lib/modules/$(uname -r) -name 'dummy_hcd*' -o -name 'libcomposite*'
command -v usbipd
```

**Windows (client side):**

- [usbip-win2](https://github.com/vadimgrn/usbip-win2) signed MSI release
- Test signing enabled or a properly signed build; install requires a reboot
- `usbip.exe` on PATH

## Linux setup

```bash
sudo bash sim/setup_usbip_gadget.sh
```

This loads modules, mounts configfs, builds the gadget at
`/sys/kernel/config/usb_gadget/moza`, binds to `dummy_udc.0`, and starts
`usbipd`. Output ends with the busid to attach from Windows (typically
`1-1`). `/dev/ttyGS0` appears with `rw` for all users.

Start the simulator:

```bash
python3 sim/wheel_sim.py /dev/ttyGS0
```

The simulator auto-loads the default VGS capture as a replay table if
`usb-capture/12-04-26-2/moza-startup-1.pcapng` exists. Identity probes are
also answered by hardcoded handlers in `_VGS_ID_RSP`, so the sim works even
without any capture file.

## Windows attach

```
usbip list -r <linux-ip>
usbip attach -r <linux-ip> -b 1-1
```

Device Manager should show a USB CDC device with `VID_346E&PID_0006`, and a
new COM port appears. PitHouse's WMI scan picks it up; point PitHouse at the
COM port or let it auto-detect.

## Passthrough (MITM) mode

Run a real MOZA base on the Linux dev host, forward it to Windows over USBIP,
and log every framed message in the middle. Useful for diffing real-hardware
conversation against `wheel_sim.py` responses.

Pipeline:

```
PitHouse (Win) ─usbip─► /dev/ttyGS0 ◄─► bridge.py ◄─► /dev/ttyACMx ─USB─► real base
```

The libcomposite gadget is reused unchanged — Windows still attaches the same
`1-1` busid. `bridge.py` replaces `wheel_sim.py` as the user-space process
holding `/dev/ttyGS0`; instead of synthesising responses it pumps bytes to
and from the real base.

Steps:

1. Plug the real MOZA base into the Linux host. Confirm it enumerates as a
   CDC ACM device:
   ```bash
   ls /dev/ttyACM*
   ```
   The status script warns about this device (`Real MOZA wheel detected …
   may interfere on re-setup`); in passthrough mode that warning is
   expected.
2. Build the gadget exactly as for the simulator:
   ```bash
   sudo bash sim/setup_usbip_gadget.sh
   ```
3. Start the bridge instead of `wheel_sim.py`:
   ```bash
   python3 sim/bridge.py /dev/ttyACM0
   ```
   `/dev/ttyGS0` is the default gadget endpoint; pass a second positional
   arg to override. JSONL log goes to `sim/logs/bridge-<ts>.jsonl` unless
   `--log` is given.
4. From Windows: `usbip attach -r <linux-ip> -b 1-1`. PitHouse opens the
   COM port; every byte flows through the bridge.

Each log record is one frame:

```json
{"t": 1714200000.123, "dir": "h2b", "len": 8, "ok": true,
 "grp": 67, "dev": 23, "payload": "0701..", "hex": "7e04432307010100.."}
```

`dir` is `h2b` (PitHouse → base) or `b2h` (base → PitHouse). `ok=false` means
the checksum did not verify — usually a sync glitch, occasionally a real
escape-handling bug worth investigating.

### MCP control

The bridge ships an MCP stdio server registered in `.mcp.json` as
`bridge-linux` (defaults: `/dev/ttyACM0` ↔ `/dev/ttyGS0`). Tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `bridge_start` | Open both ports + start pumps. Args: `base_port`, `gadget_port`, `log_path` (all optional, defaults from server config). |
| `bridge_stop` | Stop pumps; cross-process kill if another bridge owns the gadget. |
| `bridge_info` | Configured ports + running flag (cheap). |
| `bridge_status` | Frame/byte counters, uptime, current paths. |
| `bridge_recent(count, direction)` | Last N frames (rolling 2000); filter `h2b` / `b2h`. |
| `bridge_histogram(top)` | Per-(dir, group, device, cmd) frame count. |
| `bridge_counters` | Aggregate frame + byte totals per direction. |
| `bridge_reset_counters` | Zero counters; JSONL trace untouched. |
| `bridge_log_path` | Current log path + on-disk size. |

Bridge and wheel-sim share the same lockfile name
(`/tmp/wheel_sim_<port-slug>.lock`), so starting one while the other holds
`/dev/ttyGS0` returns a structured conflict with the owner pid. `bridge_stop`
/ `sim_stop` will SIGTERM a cross-process owner.

## Capture workflow

1. Start Wireshark on Linux. Capture on the `lo` interface filtered to
   `tcp.port == 3240` (USBIP), or on the gadget's USB endpoint.
2. `python3 sim/wheel_sim.py /dev/ttyGS0`
3. Launch PitHouse on Windows.
4. Let PitHouse finish its startup probes (~3–5 s).
5. Save capture to `usb-capture/` as PCAPNG.
6. Extend the replay table:
   `python3 sim/wheel_sim.py --replay-handshake <new.pcapng>`

## Status check

```bash
sudo bash sim/status_usbip_gadget.sh
```

Prints `[OK]`/`[FAIL]`/`[WARN]` for each component: kernel modules, configfs,
UDC binding, VID/PID, ttyGS0, usbipd, TCP 3240, usbip binding, remote
export, and real MOZA wheel conflict detection.

## Teardown

```bash
sudo bash sim/teardown_usbip_gadget.sh
```

Unbinds usbip, removes configfs entries, stops `usbipd`, and unloads kernel
modules (`libcomposite`, `dummy_hcd`). Safe to run multiple times. Full module
unload ensures re-setup starts from clean state.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---------|-------|
| `No dummy_udc.N in /sys/class/udc/` | `modprobe dummy_hcd` succeeded? `ls /sys/class/udc/` |
| `/dev/ttyGS0` missing | `echo dummy_udc.0 > $GADGET/UDC` returned success? `dmesg \| tail` |
| `usbip list -r` from Windows hangs | Linux firewall blocking TCP 3240; `usbipd -D` running? |
| PitHouse doesn't see the device | VID wrong (`cat $GADGET/idVendor` → `0x346e`)? Driver installed (Device Manager → Ports)? |
| Sim logs `unhandled grp=0xNN dev=0x17` | PitHouse probe the sim doesn't answer; add to `_VGS_ID_RSP` or load a newer capture with `--replay-responses` |
| Gadget stops working after plugging real MOZA wheel | Run `sudo bash sim/teardown_usbip_gadget.sh && sudo bash sim/setup_usbip_gadget.sh` — teardown now fully unloads modules to clear stale state |
| Cannot diagnose issue | Run `sudo bash sim/status_usbip_gadget.sh` for a full health check |
